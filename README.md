# WQU-Capstone---Piotroski-F-Score-Analysis
Application of F-Score technique to select value stocks for investment.

In this group project work, a portfolio of 5 securities are selected. Data for these securities are downloaded using their TICKERs and F-Score Analysis is applied to see how the portfolio performs with respect to the 9 indicators.

Piotroski technique, also known as F-Score, is a quantitative analysis method used to evaluate the financial health and strength of a company. It was developed by Joseph Piotroski, a professor at Stanford University, and is based on a set of nine financial and accounting criteria to identify financially healthy companies worth investing in.

The nine criteria are as follows:

Net Income: Whether a company has reported a positive net income.

Return on Assets: Whether the company's ROA has improved over the previous year.

Cash Flow: Whether the company generated positive cash flow from operations.

Long-Term Debt: Whether the company has reduced long-term debt in comparison to the previous year.

Current Ratio: Whether the company's current assets are sufficient to cover current liabilities.

Gross Margin: Whether the company has improved its gross margin in comparison to the previous year.

Asset Turnover: Whether the company has improved its asset turnover ratio in comparison to the previous year.

Issuance of New Shares: Whether the company has issued new shares or not.

Operating Efficiency: Whether the company has improved its operating efficiency in comparison to the previous year.


Note: We are still working on finding the ways to get financial indicators data for NYSE S&P 500. This is just a sample code to start the collabration and share our progress.
