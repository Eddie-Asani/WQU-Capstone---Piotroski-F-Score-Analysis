Applying PCA and Neural Network on Piotroski scores to predict stock Returns..

In order to improve returns on the S&P 500 equities, the project is focused on modernizing the Piotroski score framework using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and neural networks. Piotroski Score, often known as F-score, is a method that is frequently employed for selecting value stocks. F-score is the sum of nine equally weighed quantitative scores representing the business's fundamentals. Financial analysts and investors have long used the F score as a prominent indicator since it was originally introduced by Piotroski et al. Numerous investment methods have been created as a result of extensive research on the F score. Due to their equally balanced weights, the trade-off of learning more about 9 often used basics may be simply comprehended. 

Numerous studies have examined the efficiency of an adjusted F-score in order to maximize its capabilities. These studies used methods like adding extra indices or reducing the index using regression algorithms. On the contrary, we discovered that F score wasn't subjected to or reported utilizing PCA, a potent method for identifying the most important variables amongst every factor. PCA can highlight the most significant principal element, or primary elements, and reduce the weights of less significant components in a multivariable model constructed as an F-score. Recent research on the use of PCA to financial data by academics has produced interesting results. 

The nine criteria are as follows:

Net Income: Whether a company has reported a positive net income.

Return on Assets: Whether the company's ROA has improved over the previous year.

Cash Flow: Whether the company generated positive cash flow from operations.

Long-Term Debt: Whether the company has reduced long-term debt in comparison to the previous year.

Current Ratio: Whether the company's current assets are sufficient to cover current liabilities.

Gross Margin: Whether the company has improved its gross margin in comparison to the previous year.

Asset Turnover: Whether the company has improved its asset turnover ratio in comparison to the previous year.

Issuance of New Shares: Whether the company has issued new shares or not.

Operating Efficiency: Whether the company has improved its operating efficiency in comparison to the previous year.
